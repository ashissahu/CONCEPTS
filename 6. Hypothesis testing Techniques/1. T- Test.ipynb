    "T- Test :- A t-test is a type of inferential statistic which is used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups which may be related in certain features. It is mostly used when the data sets, like the set of data recorded as outcome from flipping a coin a 100 times, would follow a normal distribution and may have unknown variances. T test is used as a hypothesis testing tool, which allows testing of an assumption applicable to a population.  \n",
